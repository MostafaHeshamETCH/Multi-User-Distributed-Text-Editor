# multi_user_distributed_text_editor

A trial to implement a multi-user distributed text editor.

Implemented By:

1. Maryam Ahmed Glal
2. Youssef Sherif Mohamed
3. Mostafa Hesham Abd El Raouf

## Getting Started

Requirements
Since this is a course in distributed systems, we want it to have “interesting” features from a systems perspective. Here are some important properties your system should have:
• The system must support multiple, autonomous agents (either human or automated) contending for shared resources and performing real-time updates to some form of shared state.
• The state of the system should be distributed across multiple client or server nodes.
• The system should be robust
• The system should be able to continue operation even if one of the participant nodes crashes.
• It should be possible to recover the state of a node following a crash, so that it can resume operation.
• You may use any of the packages in the Python (or comparable packages in whatever language you choose.)
• You are allowed to use external packages to support the application or user interface.

## Will probably use

1. AppWrite for real time database features
2. QuillEditor as a UI for the text editor
3. Riverpod for state management
4. Routemaster for Routing
